# 👋 Hi, I'm Legare (luh-gree) Kerrison!

❤️ I'm a Developer Advocate at Red Hat working on all things open source AI tooling.

🧪 I'm especially focused on LLM fine-tuning, model demos, and developer enablement.

🤞 [Asprational] I share quick demos on YouTube with my channel **[How Not What](https://www.youtube.com/@hownotwhat)** — built to show the _how_ behind building with AI, not just the _what_.
